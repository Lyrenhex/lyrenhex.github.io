                                        I am, personally, a major supporter of free software, often helping to advocate
                                        for its use, and attempting to encourage and congratulate those expanding companies
                                        who see the potential in free software and take advantage of the benefits that a
                                        free world does afford. (Of course, I'm not talking cost here -- I mean free as in

                                            UK Labour Party
                                        </h2>
</div>
<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
                                        For the past three years I've been a dedicated supporter of the UK Labour
                                        party, sticking with them through their difficult turbulence with Mr Milliband,
                                        and praising them on their selection of Jeremy Corbyn - promised to be
                                        the true embodiment of the Labour beliefs - to be leader of the party.
                                    </div>
<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
                                        Having said that, however, the Labour party have been increasingly
                                        failing the British public, doing only what is required of them in Parliamentary
                                        debates, and not going further than that to fight for what they believe in.
                                        Not to say, of course, that I have an issue, per say, with Jeremy Corbyn;
                                        I have yet to find reliable evidence to believe him to have failed in his duty,
                                        but yet his own party have, for the most part, aligned themselves <i>against</i>
                                        him. This, itself, suggests disloyalty within the Labour party - if they can't
                                        support their leader, how could they ever hope to support the British public?
                                    </div>
<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
                                        Despite, I have stuck with them, enduring the relatively hypocritical outcries
                                        from the Conservative party (of whom's leader is the true definition of lightweight).
                                        But, on Thursday 17<sup>th</sup> November 2016, the Labour party have betrayed
                                        the people for the last time, when they voted to pass the Investigatory Powers
                                        Act, legalising the mass surveillance of <b>every UK citizen</b> indiscriminately
                                        and without reason. Along with this autocratic invasion of privacy, the GCHQ
                                        have been granted the power to hack into citizen's computers, microphones,
                                        and webcams, provided they have simply a warrant. <i>This is not the world
                                            I wish to live in</i> where my rights as a human being are cast aside by the
                                        very governmental body that promised to protect them.

<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
                                        However, despite my issues with the Labour party, no issue is without its
                                        solution. Thus, after desparate searching for an alternative party that
                                        actually cares for its supporters' freedoms, I encountered the very party
                                        that everyone had forgotten; the solution to our problem, "the only party
                                        fighting to keep Britain open, tolerant, and united": the Liberal Democrats.
                                    </div>
<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
                                        With Tim Farron, a Member of Parliament who repeatedly demonstrates his
                                        care for the working class, even being described as "an ally of farmers" by
                                        the NFU, being elected two times thus far as the LibDem leader, it shouldn't
                                        be much of a surprise to learn that the Liberal Democrats were the only
                                        complete party to vote against the Investigatory Powers Bill in the House of
                                        Commons. Not only that, but the Liberal Democrats have also shown
                                        consistent support for Edward Snowden, and actively fight to oppose all
                                        invasive bills - all while lobbying for a final vote for the British public on the
                                        Brexit deal, and whether we consider the terms acceptable or not.
                                    </div>
<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
                                        From a political party that was shunned and discarded by the media (unjustly, to
                                        my opinion) this goes above and beyond what I would ever have expected. In
                                        fact, Lord Paul Strasburger - a strong proponent and Peer of the Liberal
                                        Democrats - has oft criticised the totalitarian bills so commonly being pushed
                                        by the exponentially far-right Tory government.<br/><br/>
                                        I implore you, should you be a British citizen: vote for the Liberal Democrats
                                        in 2020. Only then may Britain have a chance at correcting the mistakes of
                                        2016. Is it really so bad to have a party that will fight for you? For your family?
                                        For the country?
