# My portfolio

This serves as my personal website, an actively maintained portfolio. However, it's also an extremely customizable codebase (using pretty much just HTML and CSS - no JavaScript!) for both the web and desktop, inspired largely off Jackson Hayes' Cappucino, which I felt involved too much repetition to be worthwhile.
