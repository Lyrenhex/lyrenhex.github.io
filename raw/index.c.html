                            Hi there, welcome! I'm Damian, a software and website developer from England, so I make cool little services and programs that you can run and use for free. I try to keep things neat and tidy, and I'm a perfectionist, so I aspire for my work to be the
                            best it possibly can be before I will be satisfied with releasing it to the wider public. That said, all my current projects are open-source, free software, for I'm an avid supporter of the <a href="http://fsf.org" target="_blank">Free Software Foundation</a>.
                            (In fact, this very website is open source and licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3. Neat, eh?) I prefer to work in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (mostly Node.JS), and, sometimes, Python.
                        </div>
                        <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
                            When it comes to me personally, I love tea - though I don't really think that's much of a surprise now, is it? I'm passionate about my work, and learning, well, anything! From Classical Latin to Pure Mathematics, I enjoy finding out about new things,
                            understanding new concepts, and learning anything at all, really. Of course, I also endeavour to keep up-to-date with specs and standards, especially since I develop websites (like the one you're looking at right now); and the web is notorious for
                            changing standards and introducing new specifications.

                            I'm also a massive fan of Google, and most things related to them. I know what you're thinking: "But wait, they clash with free software!" Well, yeah, they do - sometimes. But Google are also pretty big supporters of free software (and, in my honest
                            opinion, one of the most transparent companies I know of when it comes to what data they keep), and their Material Design spec is amazing, in my opinion, so...

                            Otherwise, if I'm not busy working on a project or playing games (because Skyrim is great, heh), then I'll usually be listening to music, hanging out in an IRC chat room... or both. Of course, if you want to chat with me about music or games, or whatever,
                            then please <i>do not hesitate to get in touch!</i> I don't bite, promise!

                                            your best bet for trying to contact me - plus, the messages you send there are even out

                                            If you care about privacy (or you just love Keybase - either way is fine with me), I have an account on Keybase, which lists my GPG (PGP) keys and most of my official accounts! Woop! If you want to send me encrypted stuff, I'm perfectly fine with using KBFS, or, if you're emailing me, my public key is on Keybase -- encrypt it with that! (Note that encrypted emails should be sent to SECURE@PINGU.PW).

                                            Alternatively, if Telegram isn't really suitable for you, and you aren't comfortable with encryption, I can also handle plaintext emails.
                                            Be advised, however, that sending me a plaintext email can be read by
                                            governments and hackers, so I'd recommend sending me an encrypted email (see Keybase).
