I’m Damian, a software and website developer from England, so I make cool little services and programs (often in my spare time) that you can use <b>for free</b>. I’m also a perfectionist, so I naturally strive to make my work the very best that it possibly can before labelling it as “1.0” and releasing it to the wider public. That said, almost all of my projects are open-source, free software, for I’m an avid supporter of the <a href=https://fsf.org>Free Software Foundation</a>. (In fact fact, this very website is open source and licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3. Neat, eh?)</p><h2>Technologies</h2><p>As a developer, I <b>love</b> the tools that power the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So, most of my more recent projects have used those technologies, with desktop applications tending to use Node.JS, though I have been known to use Python from time to time (including when I expanded HTML with Transclusions in <a href=https://github.com/Scratso/Compound>Compound</a>).</p><h2>Personal</h2><p>When it comes to me as a person, though, you likely won’t be shocked to learn that I <i>love</i> tea. But, besides that, I’m extremely passionate about my work, and learning most anything. From Classical Latin to Pure Mathematics, there’s very little that I don’t have a blast while learning about.</p><p>I’m also a massive music fan (usually rock/metal/ukulele-metal-rap, if you were wondering), which you can learn more about on my WILT.FM profile.</p></div><div class=modal id=opinions><div><button class=close onclick="hideModal('opinions')">X</button></div><h2>Some of my opinions</h2><div class=card><h3>Free Software</h3><p>I am, personally, a major supporter of free software, often helping to advocate for its use and advancement, and attempting to encourage and congratulate those expanding companies who see the potential in free software and take advantage of the benefits that a free world does afford (of course, I’m not talking about cost here -- I mean free as in freedom: libera).</p><p>It’s partly for this reason that you’ll see that most of my projects are licensed under the GNU General Public License -- a free license. In fact, the source code of the page you’re reading right now is licensed under that very one!</p><p>I also happen to support Edward Snowden, of whom I have immense sympathy for his unjust situation of being in exile from the very country he aided in the revelation of secretive spying being enacted by the US Government, for years, without notice. If a country does not trust its citizens, then how can the citizens trust the country?</p></div><div class=card><h3>UK Liberal Democrats</h3><p>The Liberal Democrats (LibDems) are the modern-day Labour party: rather than fighting amongst each other and backing on their word, they fight to keep Britain “open, tolerant, and united”.</p><p>With Tim Farron, a Member of Parliament who repeatedly demonstrates his dedication to his cause and care for the working class (even being described as “an ally of farmers” by the NFU), being elected twice thus far as the LibDem leader, it shouldn’t be much of a surprise to learn that only the LibDems voted <b>completely</b> as a party against the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 in the House of Commons. They fight for the future I want, for unity, openness, and tolerance. Do you want division in your future?</p></div></div><div class=modal id=projects><div><button class=close onclick="hideModal('projects')">X</button></div><h2>My projects</h2><a href=http://ave-irc.pw><div class=card><h3>Ave IRC Client</h3><p>Ave is a new, modern IRC client designed inspired by Google's Material Design style specification. Featuring markdown support and a clean, intuitive, commandless user interface, Ave revolutionises the basic framework offered by the IRC protocol.</p></div></a><a href=https://github.com/Scratso/Compound><div class=card><h3>Compound</h3><p>Compound is a compiler for extended HTML, which adds the capability for easy transclusion of HTML files into other HTML documents; simple, clean minification; and other bandwidth and development-sanity saving solutions. In fact, Compound powers this website’s development!</p></div></a><a href=https://github.com/freechat-project/Verum><div class=card><h3>Verum</h3><p>Verum is a decentralised, federated, encrypted chat system for the super secure (or paranoid, if you prefer). Using a Node-based infrastructure, you aren’t naturally locked in to one particular server, and could even spin up your own Node if you so desired.</p></div></a></div><div class=modal id=contact><div><button class=close onclick="hideModal('contact')">X</button></div><h2>Get in touch!</h2><p>If you want to discuss a project, ask for help, or just feel like having a chat, cool! Just read the info below, pick a chat method, and send me a message -- it's that easy!</p><p>I can be contacted via a variety of means, but I advise the use of the encrypted methods over the plaintext alternatives. That means using Telegram or encrypted email over plaintext email or social media. If you need my PGP key to encrypt an email, you can find it <a href=https://keybase.io/scratso>over on my Keybase account</a>.</p><div class=card><h3>Telegram</h3><h4>Scratso</h4></div><div class=card><h3>Email</h3><h4>dh64784 [at] gmail [dot] com</h4></div></div><div class=modal id=topical><div><button class=close onclick="hideModal('topical')">X</button></div><h2>The ban on travel</h2><p>In support of <b>absolutely everyone</b> that's been affected by Trump's acts on Saturday 28<sup>th</sup> January 2017, this note will be online on my personal website for the 120 days that the ban is effective for. Once the ban is over, it will be archived, but remain publicly accessible. <b>We must never forget.</b></p><p>My heart goes out to <i>every single person</i> today who's suffering under the tyrranical rule of US President Donald Trump. I cannot hope to imagine what each and every one of you are going through, now that you'll be separated from your friends, families, and loved ones for at least the next four months. Whether you were away on a business trip, away on a visit, holiday, or anything, Trump's actions have locked you out of your own home, and I'm horrified to hear how careless and selfish Trump's treatment of his own citizens is.</p><p>If, however, whoever is reading this is not affected directly by it, and may appeal to the US Government, I implore you, along with thousands of other reasonable people: do so. The actions of President Trump have already overstepped the boundaries of a free and democratic society, in violation of the US Constitution, and are the actions of a dictator. The executive order that Trump signed, be it written by he or not, show his true nature: a racist, fascist coward that has no right of ruling the United States of America.</p><p>A visa is granted under strict checks: they should be let in. Citizens of the US have no right to be kicked out to the streets of a land they know few in. The US Government has now forgotten its goal completely. Reclaim humanity.</p><p>For the sake of mankind, <b>this needs to stop</b>.</p><p>If anyone out there needs someone to speak to, know that I am open to conversation, along with many others who have a heart. If you need to talk, do.</p></div><noscript id=deferred-styles><link href=https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto rel=stylesheet></noscript><script>
