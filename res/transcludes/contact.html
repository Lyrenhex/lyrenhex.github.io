<h2>Get in touch!</h2>
<p>If you want to discuss a project, ask for help, or just feel like having a chat, cool! Just read the info below, pick a chat method, and send me a message -- it's that easy!</p>
<p>I can be contacted via a variety of means, but I advise the use of the encrypted methods over the plaintext alternatives. That means using Telegram or encrypted email over plaintext email or social media. If you need my PGP key to encrypt an email, you can find it <a href="https://keybase.io/scratso">over on my Keybase account</a>.</p>

  <p>As a side note, the Node I reside on (node.verum.damianheaton.com) is owned and maintained by myself, through DigitalOcean. It uses the bare-bones <a href="https://github.com/freechat-project/Verum-Server">official Verum Node code</a> to run.</p>
