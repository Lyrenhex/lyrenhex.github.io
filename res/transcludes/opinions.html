  <h2>Some of my opinions: Freedom</h2>
  <p>Personally, I am a strong believer in individual freedom. Obviously, we aren&rsquo;t all locked up in prison cells all across the country (that would be ridiculous). When I say freedom, I mean the freedom of expression, the freedom to use the things that I spent money on how <i>I</i> want to use them -- even if that means bypassing a bit of DRM.</p>
  <p>Not just that, but social freedoms are important too. If we cannot remain an open, tolerant, democratic society, then how could we ever hope to move forward in a way that benefits the <b>majority</b>, not the few richmen.</p>

    <h3>Free Software</h3>
    <p>I am, personally, a major supporter of free software, often helping to advocate for its use and advancement, and attempting to encourage and congratulate those expanding companies who see the potential in free software and take advantage of the benefits that a free world does afford (of course, I&rsquo;m not talking about cost here -- I mean free as in freedom: libera).</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s partly for this reason that you&rsquo;ll see that most of my projects are licensed under the GNU General Public License -- a free license. In fact, the source code of the page you&rsquo;re reading right now is licensed under that very one!</p>
    <p>I also happen to support Edward Snowden, of whom I have immense sympathy for his unjust situation of being in exile from the very country he aided in the revelation of secretive spying being enacted by the US Government, for years, without notice. If a country does not trust its citizens, then how can the citizens trust the country?</p>

    <h3>UK Liberal Democrats</h3>
    <p>The Liberal Democrats (LibDems) are the modern-day Labour party: rather than fighting amongst each other and backing on their word, they fight to keep Britain &ldquo;open, tolerant, and united&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>With Tim Farron, a Member of Parliament who repeatedly demonstrates his dedication to his cause and care for the working class (even being described as &ldquo;an ally of farmers&rdquo; by the NFU), being elected twice thus far as the LibDem leader, it shouldn&rsquo;t be much of a surprise to learn that only the LibDems voted <b>completely</b> as a party against the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 in the House of Commons. They fight for the future I want, for unity, openness, and tolerance. Do you want division in your future?</p>

    <h3>Deceitful democracy</h3>
    <p>Each, and every, day, you are being deceived. Now, no, I&rsquo;m not a conspiracy theorist, but this is real: <b>you do not live in a democracy</b>. A democracy is, technically speaking, direct &ldquo;power to the people&rdquo;, as opposed to indirect power through a semi-frequent electoral system, which themselves have been found to be rigged numerous crucial times in the past. Consider that once you&rsquo;ve voted, your power ends: you have no say in the House of Commons, the House of Lords, or Buckingham Palace. Once a leader is elected, that person operates as a <i>democratically-elected dictator</i>. True democracy requires a complete upheavel of the governmental system, and isn&rsquo;t something you will see soon. But just remember: you do not live in a democracy. Not a true one, anyway -- no matter what your friends naively believe.</p>

  <h2>Some of my opinions: &lsquo;Brexit&rsquo; (British EU Exit)</h2>
  <p>This is a controversial topic, but it needs addressing. The short summary of my beliefs is that I am a &lsquo;Remainer&rsquo;, but I&rsquo;ve always tried, all throughout the entire Brexit campaign, to maintain an open and unbiased mindview as possible. Sadly, however, I fail to see the benefits that are afforded through leaving the single largest collection of trade partners and like-minded countries that ever did exist. My arguments relate moreso towards the future, than necessarily the present.</p>
  <p>Think of every single sci-fi book or film that handles the future. They all seem to suggest that we would be operating under a unified race, a World Government, as it were. The EU, and the EU&rsquo;s goals, would have brought us so much closer to this utopian future, supported by the democratic ratification process. Oh, wait, I just called the EU democratic, didn&rsquo;t I? Gods forbid! No matter what side you're on, that fact is true: all decisions are ratified through each independant member state. That is democracy, not a dictatorship as Mr. Farage made it out to be.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, both our military and our trade agreements benefit from the EU. Simply look at the value of the pound -- and <b>we haven&rsquo;t even left the EU yet!</b> For as long as we continue plummeting towards a &lsquo;Hard Brexit&rsquo;, this country&rsquo;s future is uncertain.</p>

  <h2>Some of my opinions: US Politics</h2>
  <p>Contrary to popular belief, I do not have my head under a rock. Rather, I had been watching intently the relatively recent US Presidential Election, of which President Donald Trump clearly won. In terms of my opinion, neither candidate for the White House was acceptable: President Trump&rsquo;s obligations are, quite clearly, centered more on his business than they are on the Presidency (a business he seems to be unwilling to give up, according to him claim that &ldquo;the public knew of his business when they voted him&rdquo;), and, as a businessman, he&rsquo;s already been proven to be corrupt, foolish, and manipulative -- so, ultimately, unfit for the role that he's been granted.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was also an unfit candidate for the Opal Office, noting her disregard for national security in storing her emails on a private server -- which, based on the leaks provided by WikiLeaks, aren&rsquo;t inclined to support her cause -- was clearly not suited for the Presidential seat.</p>
  <p>To my own opinion, the only acceptable options were Bernie Sanders, or Jill Stein of the US Green Party. Though, sadly, neither of these candidates won.</p>
  <div class="card">
    <p>With regards to the executive order that was enacted Saturday 28<sup>th</sup> January 2017, my heart does go out to every US Citizen that was affected by the order, and it proves just how unfit President Trump is to rule, opting to shut out people who&rsquo;d already been granted visas, after extreme vetting already. Consider the danger those people may have been in in their home countries, which President Trump has renewed? Or the hundreds of Google employees confirmed to be stranded outside of the US (despite Sundar Pichai&rsquo;s best efforts)? As it is, I stand with everyone harmed, stranded, and cut off from their family as a direct consequence of the President&rsquo;s ruling, and, should you need someone to talk to, know that I am here regardless.</p>
