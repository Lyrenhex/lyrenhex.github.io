<h2>Some of my opinions</h2>
<div class="card">
  <h3>Free Software</h3>
  <p>I am, personally, a major supporter of free software, often helping to advocate for its use and advancement, and attempting to encourage and congratulate those expanding companies who see the potential in free software and take advantage of the benefits that a free world does afford (of course, I&rsquo;m not talking about cost here -- I mean free as in freedom: libera).</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s partly for this reason that you&rsquo;ll see that most of my projects are licensed under the GNU General Public License -- a free license. In fact, the source code of the page you&rsquo;re reading right now is licensed under that very one!</p>
  <p>I also happen to support Edward Snowden, of whom I have immense sympathy for his unjust situation of being in exile from the very country he aided in the revelation of secretive spying being enacted by the US Government, for years, without notice. If a country does not trust its citizens, then how can the citizens trust the country?</p>

  <h3>UK Liberal Democrats</h3>
  <p>The Liberal Democrats (LibDems) are the modern-day Labour party: rather than fighting amongst each other and backing on their word, they fight to keep Britain &ldquo;open, tolerant, and united&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>With Tim Farron, a Member of Parliament who repeatedly demonstrates his dedication to his cause and care for the working class (even being described as &ldquo;an ally of farmers&rdquo; by the NFU), being elected twice thus far as the LibDem leader, it shouldn&rsquo;t be much of a surprise to learn that only the LibDems voted <b>completely</b> as a party against the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 in the House of Commons. They fight for the future I want, for unity, openness, and tolerance. Do you want division in your future?</p>
