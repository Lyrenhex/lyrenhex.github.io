  <h3>Ave IRC Client</h3>
  <p>Ave is a new, modern IRC client designed inspired by Google's Material Design style specification. Featuring markdown support and a clean, intuitive, commandless user interface, Ave revolutionises the basic framework offered by the IRC protocol.</p>
  <p>With the unique dashboard system also offered by Ave, Ave is able to handle multiple servers, giving you one-click access to every IRC channel you need in your daily lives. Not just that, you don&rsquo;t need to mess around with the hassle that is HexChat&rsquo;s channel list system: Ave will keep track of your connected channels throughout your chatting, so that when you next open Ave, you're greeted with the exact same set of channels as when you closed it.</p>
  <p>Ave is freely available under the GNU General Public License <a href="http://github.com/Scratso/Ave">here, on its GitHub page</a>.</p>

  <h3>Compound</h3>
  <p>Compound is a compiler for extended HTML, which adds the capability for easy transclusion of HTML files into other HTML documents; simple, clean minification; and other bandwidth and development-sanity saving solutions. In fact, Compound powers this website&rsquo;s development!</p>
  <p>Further features of Compound include the ability to streamline web pages into (almost) <b>entirely self-sufficient</b> pages. What do I mean by that, you say? Webpages are always limited in speed and bandwidth by external calls, be it to script files or CSS files, which are broken off from the primary webpage to make website development. Unfortunately, these external calls also slow down website delivery, increasing the time that a user has to wait for the page to show. The solution? Compound. Compound features the ability to insert external CSS and JavaScript files into the HTML file during compile, meaning that the developers get to work on a nice, broken-up page system, and users get their pages almost instantly: win-win!</p>
  <p>You can check out Compound <a href="https://github.com/Scratso/Compound">on GitHub</a>, or check the documentation <a href="https://github.com/Scratso/Compound/wiki">on the project wiki</a>.

  <h3>Verum</h3>
  <p>Verum is a decentralised, federated, encrypted chat system for the super secure (or paranoid, if you prefer). Using a Node-based infrastructure, you aren&rsquo;t naturally locked in to one particular server, and could even spin up your own Node if you so desired.</p>
  <p>Verum, in practice, operates rather similarly to email: you send a message to a user based on a <code>user</code>@<code>node</code> format, which is parsed, and the message is sent to the <code>node</code>. However, Verum is significantly lighter than email, and is built with encryption as its central goal, allowing public keys to be stored in the user&rsquo;s account rather than requiring an additional key server. This approach greatly simplifies encryption, both to new users and veterans alike.</p>
  <p>Further arguments in favour of Verum are its open-source architecture, with the server code licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (version 3 or later). The use of the Affero variant requires all Verum Nodes to have their source publicly accessible to users -- and, sure enough, this functionality is built into the "handshake" between the client and server establishing a connection.</p>
  <p>You can <a href="http://verum.damianheaton.com">read more about Verum and its future here</a>, or, if you prefer, I&rsquo;ve recently released the official <a href="http://cli.verum.damianheaton.com">Verum Command-line App</a> (which works best on GNU / Linux). Don&rsquo;t scream at me though; a GUI app is coming!

<h2>Things I&rsquo;ve done in the past</h2>
<p>Ah, but of course, people don&rsquo;t <i>just</i> work on things here and now; what about my previous projects or one-off throwaway things <s>that really aren&rsquo;t worth looking at</s>? Check &rsquo;em out!</p>

  <h3>Wilted</h3>
  <p>Ever heard of last.fm? No? Well, it&rsquo;s a music scrobbling site, which means that you listen to music and it gets tracked on there. Sounds cool? It did to over 400 other people too, until last.fm started reaching for money. Not everyone can afford Â£3 a month for a tracking service, you see, and CBS (the guys behind it) started scoffing at the people using Adblock (... well, not really, but they put interstitials up on <b>every. bloody. page</b>). So, in comes <a href="https://wilt.fm">wilt.fm</a>, a free and open source alternative, which I&rsquo;m a user of. Unfortunately, I listen to music using <a href="http://googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com">Google Play Music Desktop Player</a>, which has no scrobbler for wilt.fm. So I made one, and that is Wilted.</p>
  <p>Interested? Wilted&rsquo;s actually on wilt.fm&rsquo;s &ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo; page! ... Or you can just check it out <a href="https://github.com/Scratso/Wilted">here, on GitHub</a>.</p>
