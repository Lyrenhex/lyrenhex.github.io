<h2>The ban on travel</h2>
<p>In support of <b>absolutely everyone</b> that's been affected by Trump's acts on Saturday 28<sup>th</sup> January 2017, this note will be online on my personal website for the 120 days that the ban is effective for. Once the ban is over, it will be archived, but remain publicly accessible. <b>We must never forget.</b></p>
<p>My heart goes out to <i>every single person</i> today who's suffering under the tyrranical rule of US President Donald Trump. I cannot hope to imagine what each and every one of you are going through, now that you'll be separated from your friends, families, and loved ones for at least the next four months. Whether you were away on a business trip, away on a visit, holiday, or anything, Trump's actions have locked you out of your own home, and I'm horrified to hear how careless and selfish Trump's treatment of his own citizens is.</p>
<p>If, however, whoever is reading this is not affected directly by it, and may appeal to the US Government, I implore you, along with thousands of other reasonable people: do so. The actions of President Trump have already overstepped the boundaries of a free and democratic society, in violation of the US Constitution, and are the actions of a dictator. The executive order that Trump signed, be it written by he or not, show his true nature: a racist, fascist coward that has no right of ruling the United States of America.</p>
<p>A visa is granted under strict checks: they should be let in. Citizens of the US have no right to be kicked out to the streets of a land they know few in. The US Government has now forgotten its goal completely. Reclaim humanity.</p>
<p>For the sake of mankind, <b>this needs to stop</b>.</p>
<p>If anyone out there needs someone to speak to, know that I am open to conversation, along with many others who have a heart. If you need to talk, do.</p>
