<h2>Hi there!</h2>
<p>Hi, and welcome! I&rsquo;m Damian, a software and website developer from England, so I make cool little services and programs (often in my spare time) that you can use <b>for free</b>. I&rsquo;m also a perfectionist, so I naturally strive to make my work the very best that it possibly can before labelling it as &ldquo;1.0&rdquo; and releasing it to the wider public. That said, almost all of my projects are open-source, free software, for I&rsquo;m an avid supporter of the <a href="https://fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>. (In fact fact, this very website is open source and licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3. Neat, eh?)</p>
<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>As a developer, I <b>love</b> the tools that power the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So, most of my more recent projects have used those technologies, with desktop applications tending to use Node.JS, though I have been known to use Python from time to time (including when I expanded HTML with Transclusions in <a href="https://github.com/Scratso/Compound">Compound</a>).</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>When it comes to me as a person, though, you likely won&rsquo;t be shocked to learn that I <i>love</i> tea. But, besides that, I&rsquo;m extremely passionate about my work, and learning most anything. From Classical Latin to Pure Mathematics, there&rsquo;s very little that I don&rsquo;t have a blast while learning about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a massive music fan (usually rock/metal/ukulele-metal-rap, if you were wondering), which you can learn more about on my WILT.FM profile.</p>
