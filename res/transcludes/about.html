<h2>Hi there!</h2>
<p>Hi, and welcome! I&rsquo;m Damian, a software and website developer from England, so I make cool little services and programs (often in my spare time) that you can use <b>for free</b>. I&rsquo;m also a perfectionist, so I naturally strive to make my work the very best that it possibly can before labelling it as &ldquo;1.0&rdquo; and releasing it to the wider public. That said, almost all of my projects are open-source, free software, for I&rsquo;m an avid supporter of the <a href="https://fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>. (In fact fact, this very website is open source and licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3. Neat, eh?)</p>
<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>As a developer, I <b>love</b> the tools that power the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So, most of my more recent projects have used those technologies, with desktop applications tending to use Node.JS, though I have been known to use Python from time to time (including when I expanded HTML with Transclusions in <a href="https://github.com/Scratso/Compound">Compound</a>).</p>

<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>When it comes to me as a person, though, you likely won&rsquo;t be shocked to learn that I <i>love</i> tea. But, besides that, I&rsquo;m extremely passionate about my work, and learning most anything. From Classical Latin to Pure Mathematics, there&rsquo;s very little that I don&rsquo;t have a blast while learning about.</p>
<h2>Passions</h2>
<div class="card">
  <h3>Music</h3>
  <p>Personally, I absolutely <i>love</i> music, usually going for rock, metal, and such over pop. I&rsquo;m also not a massive rap fan, in general, although one of my absolutely favourite bands is Hollywood Undead... Either way, you can see a decent amount more about my music taste, favourite tracks, et cetera, on my <a href="https://wilt.fm/profile/Scratso">wilt.fm profile</a>.</p>
  <p>And in case you&rsquo;re wondering about my usual music player, I generally resort to Google Play Music. There are a few reasons for this, really: one is that I adore material design, and Google Play Music (especially the web app) satisfies that massively. However, there's also a convenience aspect; I&rsquo;m forever switching between desktop and mobile, listening on my desktop computer at home and mobile when I&rsquo;m out, and I prefer having my music sync seamlessly between the two devices without me having to copy my music over by microSD. For this purpose, Google Play Music also works perfectly. (On desktop, I use <a href="https://googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com">Google Play Music Desktop Player</a>.)</p>
