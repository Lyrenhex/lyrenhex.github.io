  <p>Some non-free JavaScript code is executed for analytical purposes, using Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics, sequentially. No identifying data is transmitted, however, if this use is disagreed with, Adblock usually blocks Google Tag Manager (from my own testing), or you may disable JavaScript entirely for a degraded browsing experience.</p>

  <h3>Technical information</h3>
  <p>This website is programmed by hand, using only Compound for a 3rd Party Tool. This process is done to simplify and speed up website development, allowing for the site to be broken up in the source into many smaller files, before being stitched up into one large, minified production file on release.</p>
  <p>The website has also been created following Google's &ldquo;Mobile First&rdquo; website development guidelines, and is then gracefully upgraded via the use of free JavaScript to create the desktop edition of the site. This upgrade occurs when the JavaScript event handler, which is attached to the window resize event, detects that the window's width is greater than, or equal to, 1,000 pixels. Therefore, should JavaScript be disabled, a mobile edition of the site will be served regardless of screen size. This edition of the site removes modals, displaying all information sequentially in a rather long webpage.</p>
  <p>For examples of how this website was accomplished, please feel free to check out the source code (see above link). Should you wish for a website like this one for yourself, please also feel free to contact me with an odd-job request, which I would likely accept and create a similarly striking, and quick, site. For speed examples, this site (at time of writing) scores 99% for mobile friendliness, 91% for mobile speed, and 94% for desktop speed, based on results provided by <a href="https://testmysite.withgoogle.com">Test My Site With Google</a>.</p>
